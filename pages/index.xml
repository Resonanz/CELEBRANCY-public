      <description>Testimonial I can highly recommend Llew as a funeral celebrant for anyone who wants a service filled with dignity and that personal touch which helps make the day a memorable one for family and friends.
Llew is a helpful and compassionate person, He can facilitate a simple, no fuss service to a more contemporary celebration of a life with, or without, spiritual content.
He is professional in his approach, being there at all stages of the planning, helping people to relax, guiding them through the service, incorporating the ideas and wishes of the family, and making suggestions from his years of experience.</description>

      <description>Over the past 35 years, I have had the amazing privilege and honour of being involved with people at significant times in their lives. I have helped people celebrate and mourn in a way that is unique and meaningful and planned by their family. In doing so, I have developed the compassion needed to help people face the challenges of life and walk the journey. Llew pictured with Ann, his wife of over 43 years.</description>
