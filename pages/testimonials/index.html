    <p>Testimonial
I can highly recommend Llew as a funeral celebrant for anyone who wants a service filled with dignity and that personal touch which helps make the day a memorable one for family and friends.</p>

<p>Llew is a helpful and compassionate person, He can facilitate a simple, no fuss service to a more contemporary celebration of a life with, or without, spiritual content.</p>

<p>He is professional in his approach, being there at all stages of the planning, helping people to relax, guiding them through the service, incorporating the ideas and wishes of the family, and making suggestions from his years of experience. He is “real.”</p>

<p>In recommending him to anyone in this role, I know he will always do an excellent job.</p>

<p>Testimonial
Llew King was our wedding celebrant for our wedding on the 14th of January 2012. We were very happy with the way Llew ran the service and how he made it unique and tailored it to be exactly how we wanted it.</p>

<p>We also had marriage preparation classes with Llew which we found very helpful in preparing us for married life. His friendly relaxed manner made the classed enjoyable and non-threatening.</p>

<p>Llew was great in the way he gave us advice and guidance in planning our service when there were so many decisions to be made.</p>

<p>We highly recommend Llew King as a wedding celebrant and would like to thank Llew for making our wedding day so special.</p>

<p>Testimonial
I am a marriage celebrant and also conduct funeral services. When my husband died recently I contemplated conducting his funeral service as I felt he deserved the best possible funeral service to reflect the beautiful person he was. I was aware, however, that emotionally this would take a toll and decided if I could find the right person who I felt could could give my husband the service I wanted that I would get that person to do it. That person was found and his name is Llew King.</p>

<p>I was very impressed by the way he spoke and made helpful suggestions during a very sad time for us. He wanted the funeral service to be everything we wanted and on the day it was and we have had many lovely comments about the service and particularly Llew’s conduct of the service. He is a very extraordinary person and I would highly recommend him in his role as a Celebrant for funerals and also believe he would be equally good in the role of Marriage Celebrant or Christenings.</p>

<p>Testimonial
I have known Llew for more than 40 years and I commend him as a funeral celebrant.</p>

<p>Llew is aptly qualified in working with people at their point of need. He has a deep understanding of grief and what it entails.</p>

<p>To each individual occasion he brings attentiveness, empathy and sensitivity as he supports people through difficult times in their lives.</p>

<p>Testimonial (photos)
On the 7th of April we were wed by Llew King. We choose Llew as he was the best person we could think of and our first choice.</p>

<p>Leading up to the wedding we had a few get togethers with Llew to plan how we were gonna make the day a great success. Llew was very helpful and put forward some great ideas, Also he gave amazing advice on marriage. We really like how Llew shared a few laughs and good stories.</p>

<p>He is a great celebrant who made our day perfect. I highly recommend Llew for all occasions. Whatever your needs, Llew can accommodate.</p>

<p>Thank you you very much Llew — couldn’t have turned out better.</p>
